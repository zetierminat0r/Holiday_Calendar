# Holiday Calendar Generator

## About

Welcome to the Holiday Calendar Generator, the ultimate tool for generating .ics files for those who love holidays almost as much as they love forgetting when they are! Perfect for everyone from the overly enthusiastic HR department to the slightly forgetful employee who still thinks it's 1999. This nifty script ensures you never miss out on wishing you were off work on a holiday again.

## Features

- **Generate Holiday Calendars**: For any company, any year, and for a duration of "however long you think you'll manage to stay employed."
- **Company Specific**: Generates holidays with your company's name, so you know whom to thank for that day off.
- **Future-Proof**: Designed to work until the year computers decide they no longer need humans. After that, well, you won't need a calendar.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/holiday-calendar-generator.git` or just download the ZIP if you're not a smelly nerd.

## Usage

```
python holiday_calendar_create.py <Company Name> <Number of Years>
```

## Output

## Closing Thoughts

Remember, a well-planned holiday calendar is the first step toward pretending you have your life together. Enjoy responsibly, and always plan your holiday greetings in advance. Who knows? This might be the year you finally send them out on time.
